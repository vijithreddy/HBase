Step 1) Choose the node which runs HBASE master on it.

Step 2) Clone YCSB git repository by entering the following command
$> git clone http://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git

Step 3) After successfully cloning the repository, go to YCSB directory (CD ~/YCSB) and check the pom.xml, 
make sure that the HBASE version is in match with your installed version. 
Once you are done with that run the following command
mvn clean package (Make sure you have maven downloaded)

Step 4) After maven sets up all the libraries to your YCSB directory. 
Navigate to /YCSB/hbase/src/main/conf and open hbase-site.xml file. The file looks like following:

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://<HBASE-MASTER-SERVER>:20001/hbase</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.master</name>
    <value><HBASE-MASTER-SERVER>:60000</value>
    <description>The host and port that the HBase master runs at.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value><HBASE-MASTER-SERVER></value>
  </property>
</configuration>

Replace the <HBASE-MASTER-SERVER> with the public IP address of the HBASE master node and save the file.

Step 5) Once you are done with the above step. Go to cd ~/YCSB and execute the following command
./bin/ycsb shell basic

you will be prompted with ycsb shell where you can enter the commands (use help command for options.)
